To Do List:
- (Done) get all raw data and put in data folder
- (Done) merge all the .xlsx files into one single data base
- (Done) tidy data so each row contains information from one NBA game
- (mostly done) clean data for impossible values
- gather separate data that may have some pertinent relationships to what 
	we're studying, e.g. a vector with population sizes for each city

MAIN IDEAS:
- for every game there is a TRUE win probability for both teams, which is
	theoretically impossible to know because sports have an infinite 
	number of variables
- for every game there is an EXPECTED win probability for both teams --> 
	this is given by the betting lines
- betting lines for a given match are completely independent of the true 
	win probability, as they are solely determined by how bettors place 
	their money
	- i.e. if Lakers play the Warriors and everyone bet on the Lakers,
	the sportsbook betting line would reflect that by making the Lakers
	the favorite and the Warriors the underdog, in spite of common sense
- these two are never equal (theoretically), so for a zero commission sportsbook, 
	there is always a team that's overvalued (true win probability < expected 
	win probability) and a team that's undervalued (true win probability > 
	expected win probability)
- teams/variables/players may change, but the schmucks betting on these games 
	will always exhibit the same tendencies (my hypothesis)
- as such, there will likely be patterns in which teams are overvalued 
	(inflated betting lines) and which are undervalued
 

Relationships to Investigate / Graph Ideas:
* We do not need to do all of these; just pick a couple that are interesting, 
	can make good looking graphics, and may reveal some cool insights*  
- Definitely need a graph that shows how true win % compares to expected (from 
	0% --> 100%
- Home field advantage 
- The relationship between the over under and the moneyline
- City population size (maybe big towns have more bets placed on their teams) 
	*could do a mapping over the US for American sports
- Could compare expected win percentage to true win percentage, and do some 
	illustrations for expected returns if you had bet on all of these matches
- Could investigate popular claims like “never take the over” or “always bet home team”
- Could investigate how previous champions do
- Could see how record at a given point in time affects how people bet (would 
	need to parse the file and get records of teams)
- Could see how bettors maybe get better as season goes on (I.e. compare returns 
	during early season months… then later season months)
- Could see how the last 3/5/10 meetings between two teams affect how bettors 
	place their money
- Margin of victory vs money line /over under
- Playing back-to-back games 
- Picking based on the direction that the line moved; severity of the movement
