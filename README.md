##GROUP PROJECT
- All the raw data files from NBA games in the past 11 seasons are in the data folder
- There's a to do list file that has some tasks that need to get tackled at some point, the main ideas for what we're investigating, and some possible relationships to investigate
- Feel free to add some relationship that want to test out if you think of it (for example Po - it was a great idea with referees, so if you can find a way to collect that data then awesome, but I think it'll be impossible)
