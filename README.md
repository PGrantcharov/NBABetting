GROUP PROJECT
- All the raw data files from NBA games in the past 11 seasons are in the
	data folder
	(https://www.sportsbookreviewsonline.com/scoresoddsarchives/nba/nbaoddsarchives.htm?fbclid=IwAR2deTtuG0fgcXCEsAYw5L3LeHs_F1WSrwTIExUO4smAwpOpMRngjY0VIHM)
- There's a to do list file that has some tasks that need to get tackled at
	some point, the main ideas for what we're investigating, and some
	possible relationships to investigate
- Feel free to add some relationship that want to test out if you think of
	it (for example Po - it was a great idea with referees, so if you can
	find a way to collect that data then awesome, but I think it'll be
	impossible to find)
